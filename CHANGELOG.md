# Pyworks.nvim Updates

## Latest Changes

### Enhanced Output Display (New)
- Increased Molten output window to 40x150 (from 20 height)
- Added auto-open for output after cell execution
- Enabled smart border cropping for better screen fit
- Updated documentation with customization instructions

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Implemented Caching Layer ✅
- Added `utils.get_cached()` function for expensive operations
- Cache Jupyter availability checks (30 second TTL)
- Cache kernel list fetching (10 second TTL)
- Reduces repeated file system calls

### 2. Extracted Common venv Logic ✅
- New utility functions in `utils.lua`:
  - `has_venv()` - Check if virtual environment exists
  - `get_python_path()` - Get Python executable from venv
  - `is_venv_configured()` - Check if venv is properly set up
  - `ensure_venv_in_path()` - Add venv to PATH
- Eliminated code duplication across modules

### 3. Converted Critical Blocking Calls to Async ✅
- `complete_setup()` now uses async for:
  - Remote plugin updates
  - Jupyter kernel creation
  - Package installation checks
- UI no longer freezes during setup operations

### 4. Documentation Updates ✅
- Removed outdated `docs/` folder
- Updated README configuration section
- Removed misleading Molten configuration options

## Performance Impact

### Before
- Setup operations blocked UI for 5-30 seconds
- Repeated kernel checks every time Molten initialized
- Multiple redundant filesystem checks

### After
- Setup runs in background with progress indicators
- Kernel list cached for 10 seconds
- Jupyter availability cached for 30 seconds
- Shared venv utilities reduce redundant checks

## Still To Do

1. **Break down complex functions in setup.lua**
   - Split large functions into smaller, testable units
   - Improve readability and maintainability

2. **Additional async conversions**
   - Package availability checks
   - Environment diagnostics

3. **Further caching opportunities**
   - Notebook metadata parsing
   - Package list caching

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test setup with slow network (package installation)
2. Verify kernel list caching works correctly
3. Ensure async operations complete properly
4. Check that cache invalidation works as expected
